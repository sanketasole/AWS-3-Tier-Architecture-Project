<h1>Web 3-Tier Architecture Project | AWS Services</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project demonstrates the development of a scalable web application using AWS services. The architecture is designed using the three-tier approach, separating the presentation, application, and data layers for enhanced scalability, security, and manageability.<br><br>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<strong>Frontend:</strong> Hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via Amazon CloudFront for low latency and high availability.<br>
<strong>Backend:</strong> Built using Amazon EC2 instances with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to ensure fault tolerance and distribute traffic.<br>
<strong>Data Management:</strong> Amazon RDS is used for managing the relational database, ensuring high availability and automated backups.<br><br>

<h2>Security and Optimization</h2>
<strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> Applied IAM roles, security groups, and SSL/TLS encryption to secure the application.<br>
<strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Optimized resource usage to stay within the AWS Free Tier limits without compromising on performance.
